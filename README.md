These three visualizaations were about each MVPs average points, assists and rebounds  per game. This is extremely useful, because we can lineup these players' stats side by side and better understand how their seasons went. Surprisingly, despite many opinions, Russell Westbrook had the best MVP season out of these 10 players, according to the data. He had the second most average points, the most avarage assists, and the most avaerage rebounds. The data has shown me something that I never would have thought before displaying the data into a bar graph.
